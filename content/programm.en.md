## Our program for transformation

Our program addresses the central challenges of structural change — pragmatic, measurable and tailored to Swiss conditions.

### 1. Digital sovereignty

Critical digital systems must remain under democratic control. Swiss/EU-first for critical infrastructure and sensitive data. Anti-lock-in, open source, supply-chain security.

### 2. Re-industrialisation with robotics

More production and value creation in Switzerland — robust, modern, automated. SME-friendly with financing, shared labs and faster procedures.

### 3. Work without fear

Retraining, professional mobility and transition support as the norm — not only in crisis. Fewer hurdles, better recognition, modular education.

### 4. Life science & health with trust

Enabling progress — without losing control. Health data opt-in, evidence-based regulation, no black-box state medicine.

### 5. Basic income as a future project

Reducing existential fear, lowering bureaucracy, enabling entrepreneurship. A federal pilot with independent evaluation.

### 6. Cities & housing: comfort through density, nature through clarity

**Goal:** Affordable housing and high quality of life — through **densification where infrastructure exists**, and less sprawl in the periphery.

**What we change**
- **More building rights at transit hubs:** Around stations and strong tram/bus corridors, more floor space and height should be possible — so people can live where mobility and services already exist.
- **Fast-track permits for dense housing projects:** Clear deadlines, less back-and-forth between agencies, a "one-stop" process — so good projects get built faster.
- **Minimum densities in defined zones:** Along central corridors and near stations, densification should be the norm — not the exception.

**Our stance on height**
- **High-rises where they fit** (centres/stations) with clear quality and design requirements.
- **More mid-rise everywhere it makes sense** (e.g. 6–10 storeys), instead of endlessly expanding the urban footprint.

**What "affordable" means (pragmatically)**
- **More supply** through building where infrastructure exists.
- **Targeted complement** through cooperatives and stable rental models.
- Result: easier to move to the city, easier to stay, more everyday comfort.

### 7. Research, innovation & commons

**Goal:** Switzerland should be the place where serious innovation can be built, tested and responsibly scaled fastest — with clear public benefit and European compatibility.

**What we want**
- **Testbeds & sandboxes**: Real-world labs for new technologies — measurable, time-limited, transparently evaluated.
- **Public return from public funding**: Where the state co-finances, open standards, interoperability and knowledge transfer should be the default.
- **Nationwide innovation network**: Connecting universities, polytechnics, startups, SMEs and industry across cantons — with clear rules, transparent governance and fast implementation.

**Principle**
Innovation yes — but so that it **has broad impact**: more productivity, better services, more prosperity and comfort for all.

### 8. Energy & infrastructure resilience (reliable, affordable, independent)

**Goal:** A Switzerland that works in daily life: reliable supply, robust infrastructure and predictable costs — as the foundation for prosperity, comfort and sovereignty.

**What we change**
- **Prioritise reliability**: Plan infrastructure to better withstand outages, peak loads and crises.
- **Faster procedures for critical infrastructure**: Clear responsibilities and deadlines for projects that improve supply and reliability.
- **Reduce dependencies**: Secure critical components, spare parts and know-how where disruptions are costly — pragmatically, risk-based, European-compatible.

**Principle**
Resilience is not a mood — resilience is **engineering**: clear standards, clear responsibilities, clear redundancies.

### 9. Open government: APIs, transparency, citizen tools

**Goal:** A state that **enables** rather than blocks: data and procedures so open that citizens, media and businesses can build better tools — faster, cheaper, more transparent.

**Principle**
Everything that doesn't concern national security should be **standardised, machine-readable and publicly** available — as open data and **API-by-default**.

**Core measures**
- **API-by-default for government**: Unified interfaces, clear versioning, reliable availability.
- **Open procedures**: Government processes as open workflows — so they can be handled digitally, traceably and with third-party tools.
- **Radical transparency** (where legally possible): Budgets, procurement, contracts, KPIs, positions, salary bands — traceable and searchable.
- **Political finance transparency**: Donations, money flows, campaign budgets — clear, timely, public.
- **Strengthening citizen oversight**: Data, dashboards, audit logs — so citizen journalism and the public can effectively scrutinise the state.
- **Less gatekeeping**: Standards instead of case-by-case exceptions; less paper, more clear rules.

**Guardrail**
Openness yes — but with protection: minimise personal data, anonymise/aggregate, and security-by-design.

### 10. Neutrality & peace: protection, not escalation

**Goal:** Switzerland remains **neutral**, sovereign and credible — and once again becomes a place where peace is negotiated.

**Principle**
Neutrality means: no participation in wars, no adventures — instead **good offices**, diplomacy and humanitarian strength.

**Our security focus (defensive)**
- Protection of the population and territory
- Protection of critical infrastructure (physical and digital)
- Support for civilian authorities in crises
- Peace and humanitarian support within clear mandates

**Modernising the military: focus on protection and resilience**
- **Expand protection and resilience capabilities** (infrastructure, cyber, disaster relief)
- Clear defensive doctrine: no offensive orientation
- International role: Switzerland as host and facilitator, not as a party

### 11. Talent, integration & rule of law: open, clear, fair

**Goal:** Switzerland should be a magnet for people who want to build something — and at the same time remain a country where security, order and trust are self-evident.

**Our principle**
Those who live in Switzerland should have opportunities — and in return commit to the rules of coexistence: **rule of law, respect, responsibility**.

**What we want**
- **Switzerland as a talent hub:** We want to attract the best minds and makers — for research, SMEs, industry, health, education and startups.
- **Integration as commitment:** Those who come here should be able to arrive well — and actively become part of Switzerland (language, work, social participation).
- **Clear expectations, fair enforcement:** Rules apply to everyone. Those who violate them must expect consistent, rule-of-law enforcement — without generalisation and without blanket judgements.

**Guiding principle**
Openness and security are not contradictory. They work when integration succeeds and the rule of law is reliable.

### 12. Shared language, strong diversity

**Goal:** Switzerland should become the European model for understanding: more shared communication in everyday life and business — without displacing national languages.

**Principle**
Our national languages remain cultural substance. Additionally, we need a **practical shared lingua franca** that facilitates integration, mobility and collaboration.

**What we want**
- **English as a pragmatic lingua franca** (as a supplement, not a replacement): for government services, education pathways, research, startups, international collaboration.
- **Openness to neutral models**: We also consider constructed languages (e.g. Esperanto) and, in the long term, the possibility of a truly globally inclusive lingua franca.
- **Strengthening cultural understanding**: Language and cultural competence as part of integration, education and public service — so diversity works and trust grows.

**Guardrail**
Pragmatism over symbolism: we measure whether it improves integration, productivity and everyday comfort.
