## Why re-industrialisation?

If we want to bring production back, it must be modern: automated, efficient, resilient. This is an opportunity — especially for SMEs.

## Our priorities

- **Health & life-science supply**: Medtech, pharma-adjacent production
- **Industrial core**: Precision engineering, toolmaking, electronics/packaging
- **Resilience basics**: Food/agri-tech, grid and supply security

## The SME package

**Financing first**: Affordable loans, guarantees, co-investments for modernisation and (re-)shoring.

Plus:

- Tax incentives for automation investments
- Shared robotics labs / automation centres
- Training and upskilling vouchers
- Faster permits for modern production facilities
- Procurement advantages for critical goods (where appropriate)
- Regulatory sandboxes for automation

## Automation in the services sector

We are pro-automation when it relieves people and increases productivity — with the clear goal: more time, more freedom, more prosperity.
