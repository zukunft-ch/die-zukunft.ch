## Work without fear

Upskilling and career changes must become normal: fewer hurdles, more support, clear prospects. Those who adapt deserve a safety net — not a bureaucratic maze.

## What must change

### Fewer bureaucratic hurdles

Retraining shouldn't be an obstacle course. Applications must be simpler, approvals faster and funding more accessible.

### Better recognition of skills and certificates

Work experience and further training count — even when they don't come from the traditional education system. Competence over diplomas.

### Combining learning and work

Part-time models, work-integrated education and modular training must be promoted — for all life stages, not just career starters.

### Focus: results, not forms

Less administration, more impact. Support programmes should be measured by outcomes, not by the number of forms filled in.

## Why this is urgent

- Technology is changing job profiles faster than education systems can respond
- People need security to embrace the new
- Transitions are becoming the norm — the system must keep up
