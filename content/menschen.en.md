## Raffael Schneider

Raffael Schneider lives in Basel and works in the tech industry. He is committed to ensuring that progress doesn't create anxiety, but tangibly improves life — with more prosperity, comfort and real freedom for all.

### Why now?

Because the transformation is already under way. New technologies are changing work and daily life faster than politics can respond. The Future wants Switzerland to be prepared — so people can adapt without fear of collapse, and so progress reaches everyone.
