Around 899,000 jobs in Switzerland carry a high automation risk (>70% under
OECD methodology). The most exposed sectors: manufacturing, retail trade
and hospitality. The data show where transition strategies — such as a basic
income — are needed most urgently.

## Methodology

The analysis combines BFS-SAKE (Swiss Labour Force Survey) employment data
(2024) with OECD automation risk estimates (Nedelkoska & Quintini 2018,
updated). The OECD methodology estimates risk at the occupation level (ISCO)
and is aggregated here to the industry level (NOGA).

"High risk" means: more than 70% of tasks in an occupation are potentially
automatable. That does not mean the occupation disappears — it means the task
profile changes fundamentally.

## Policy perspective

Automation hits hardest in industries with lower qualification requirements
and lower wages. A basic income serves a dual function here:

1. **Safety net** during occupational transitions
2. **Enabler** for retraining and new forms of work
