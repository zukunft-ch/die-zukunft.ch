## Thesis

Switzerland does not have a general housing problem — it has a distribution problem. Rent burden disproportionately affects low-income households, and the market alone will not fix it.

## What the data says

The FSO survey on income and living conditions (SILC 2023) shows that households in the lowest income quintile spend an average of 35% of their income on rent. In the top quintile, it is 14%. In Zurich, Geneva, and Basel, the burden for low earners exceeds 40%.

Wüest Partner's housing market report (2024) confirms: advertised rents have risen by 12% since 2020, while existing rents were held back by the reference interest rate. This means: those who move pay significantly more. Those who stay are protected — but locked in.

Vacancy rates in the five largest cities are below 0.5% — effectively full occupancy. New construction is concentrated in the mid-range and upper price segments.

## What this means for Switzerland

- **Rent burden as a poverty factor**: When a third of income goes to rent, there is barely any room left for education, health, or retirement planning. Housing costs are the largest single item in low-income budgets.
- **Mobility is penalised**: Those who change jobs or expand their family pay significantly more on the market than in existing tenancies. This slows labour mobility and reinforces regional inequalities.
- **Basic income has a direct effect**: A basic income would reduce the rent burden ratio for the lowest quintile from 35% to under 25% — a measurable difference.

## Next step

Deeper analysis planned: how do rent controls compare internationally? A dossier on housing policy and basic income is in preparation.
