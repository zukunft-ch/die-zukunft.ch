77.0% of Switzerland's population use e-government services (2025), yet
online availability remains below the EU average. The E-ID referendum of 2021
(64.4% No) sent a clear signal: voters demand state control over digital
identity and public administration services.

## Methodology

The analysis combines BFS (Federal Statistical Office) Omnibus ICT data
(2014-2025) on e-government usage in Switzerland with the EU eGovernment
Benchmark (European Commission / Capgemini) for international comparison.
Voting motives come from the VOX post-vote survey (Sotomo) on the E-ID
referendum of 7 March 2021.

## Context

After the failed E-ID Act, Switzerland started over. The new state-issued E-ID
is set to follow a self-sovereign identity architecture — decentralised and
privacy-friendly. The earliest timeline: 2026.
