## Thesis

Switzerland wants to introduce a state-issued digital identity. The technical feasibility is given — the open question is trust. Who controls the data? Who is liable in case of misuse? And why is the public more sceptical than the administration?

## What the data says

The e-ID law was rejected at the ballot box in 2021 — with 64.4% voting no. The main reason according to the VOX analysis: not a fundamental rejection of digital identity, but distrust of private providers as identity issuers.

The new draft (2023) relies on a state-run solution with decentralised data storage on the user's device. The consultation shows broad support for the principle — but detailed questions on data protection, interoperability, and voluntariness remain open.

A Sotomo survey (2024) shows: 61% of respondents support an e-ID in principle, but only 38% trust the federal government to adequately protect their data. The trust gap is not in the technology but in the governance.

## What this means for Switzerland

- **Trust is infrastructure**: A digital identity only works if the public trusts it. This requires transparency in the code, independent audits, and clear liability rules.
- **Open source as a trust signal**: If the source code is public, civil society can verify what happens with the data. This is not a nice-to-have but a democratic minimum.
- **No compulsion, but incentives**: The e-ID must remain voluntary — but the state must ensure that non-users are not disadvantaged.

## Next step

This note is framed as a question, not an answer. We are following the parliamentary debate and will update once the law is in its final version. Open question: how do you measure trust before it is too late?
