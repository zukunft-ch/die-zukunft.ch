## Thesis

The next wave of automation is not just hitting factories — it is reaching offices, call centres, and public administrations. Switzerland, with its high wage levels, is affected particularly early, but is also particularly well positioned to manage the transition.

## What the data says

According to an OECD study (2023), around 28% of jobs in Switzerland are in occupations with high automation potential. This mainly affects repetitive office tasks (accounting, data entry, case processing) and simple services.

At the same time, SECO's structural report (2024) shows that Switzerland has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe and that new jobs are being created faster than old ones are disappearing — so far. The crucial difference from previous automation: generative AI affects analytical and creative tasks for the first time.

## What this means for Switzerland

- **Transitions, not mass unemployment**: The most likely scenario is not sudden job losses but an accelerated transformation of occupational profiles. Many positions will not disappear but will change.
- **Continuing education as infrastructure**: Switzerland needs a continuing education infrastructure as accessible as the road network — not as a luxury for high earners, but as a basic service.
- **Basic income as transition safety net**: If transitions become more frequent, a financial safety net is needed that is not tied to a specific job.

## Next step

This note will be updated once the FSO labour force survey 2025 is available. A detailed dossier on automation and basic income is in preparation.
