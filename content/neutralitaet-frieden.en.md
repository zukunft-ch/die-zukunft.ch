## Neutrality & peace
Switzerland has a unique strategic advantage: credibility through neutrality and a tradition of good offices and international mediation. This is not a myth — it is a strategic asset.

### CH-first — then lead by example
We want Switzerland to work internally: secure, resilient, sovereign. Only then can it credibly help externally. Our ambition is to lead by example — not to lecture.

### What neutrality means to us
- no participation in wars between states
- no offensive military adventures
- active peace work: mediate, host, support humanitarian efforts

### Why a protection and resilience focus makes sense
Threats have changed: hybrid risks, sabotage, cyber attacks, system failures. Critical infrastructure is the nervous system of modern Switzerland.

Therefore: expand protection capability without becoming aggressive:
- protect critical infrastructure (IT/OT, energy, communication, supply)
- support civilian authorities in crises
- clear, defensive doctrine
- high professionalism and democratic control

### Switzerland as host and facilitator for peace
We want to strengthen Switzerland's role as host for talks, negotiations and agreements — with International Geneva as a platform, and with a consistent policy of good offices.

### Guardrails
- strictly defensive: protection, not projection
- neutral and credible: no tribal politics
- transparent and rule-of-law: clear mandates, clear responsibilities
