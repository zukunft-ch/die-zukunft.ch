  { q = "Isn't this just 'money for everyone'?", a = "No. Basic income replaces a large part of today's social insurance bureaucracy with a simple, universal basic security. It is a simplification of the system — not a handout." },
  { q = "How is it financed?", a = "Through a combination of automation taxes, efficiency gains in social services and reallocation of existing transfers. Concrete models are developed with economists and social scientists." },
  { q = "Will people stop working?", a = "Research shows: no. Pilot projects worldwide demonstrate that people with basic security start businesses more often, pursue further education and work more productively — not less." },
  { q = "Why now?", a = "Automation is accelerating. Without a stabilising foundation, social disruption threatens. Basic income is a preventive measure, not a reactive one." },
  { q = "Does it apply to non-Swiss residents?", a = "The exact design — such as residency requirements and contribution periods — will be determined through democratic process. The key is the principle of universal basic security." },
  { q = "What happens to existing social benefits?", a = "Basic income replaces and simplifies existing transfer payments. The goal is not to add more on top, but to make the system simpler, more transparent and fairer." },
  { q = "Why a pilot and not immediate implementation?", a = "Because we are pragmatic. A federal pilot compares models (UBI, negative income tax, hybrid), measures impact and creates a solid basis for decision-making — instead of ideology." },
  { q = "What is measured?", a = "Three core areas: well-being and security (existential stress, stability), entrepreneurship and startups, and bureaucracy costs and administrative burden." },
