## Talent, integration & rule of law
Switzerland thrives on stability, quality and trust — and on people who contribute. We want to strengthen both: **openness for talent** and **clear rules** that apply to everyone.

### Switzerland as a hub for international talent
We want people from around the world to be able to research, found companies, work and invest in Switzerland — and for our location to become stronger as a result. This is part of our prosperity model.

### Integration means commitment
Those who move to Switzerland should not just "be here", but **arrive here**:
- learn the language and orient themselves
- access to work and education
- participation in social life
Switzerland wins when integration succeeds — and people build lasting connections with the country.

### Rule of law and security: clear, fair, without hysteria
Rules are the foundation of our trust. Therefore:
- expectations are clear and apply to everyone
- violations are **consistently enforced under the rule of law**
- no generalisations based on origin — responsibility is individual

### Why this fits The Future
Abundance and comfort emerge in a society that is **open** to capability and commitment — and **reliable** in its rules. Exactly this combination makes Switzerland strong.
