## Switzerland of the future

The Future is not a fear project. We believe in abundance — in prosperity, comfort and well-being made possible by productivity. For this to succeed, we need a state that makes change safe and truly expands freedom.

## Three principles

### 1. Positive, not panic

We define what we stand for — not just what we fight against. Switzerland has every prerequisite to actively shape this transition — not to suffer through it.

### 2. Sovereignty, not dependency

Those who don't control critical systems get controlled: through lock-in, opacity, supply-chain risks. Digital independence instead of platform dependency.

### 3. Dignity in progress

Technology must serve people. Therefore: clear rights, clear boundaries, clear accountability.

## What must change

- Bureaucracy must become lighter — not heavier.
- Retraining and career changes must become normal — not exceptional.
- Government IT must become auditable — not a black box.
- Production must become robust — not fragile.

## Security without stagnation

We stand for innovation with dignity, sovereignty by conviction, and a social contract fit for the 21st century. Not against change — but for its intelligent design.
