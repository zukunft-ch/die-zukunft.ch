## Research, innovation & commons
Prosperity emerges where new things can be built — quickly, responsibly and with real benefit. Switzerland can do this better than almost any country, if politics modernises the framework.

### Our goal
Switzerland should be the **best place** to develop and scale innovation — transparently, auditably, interoperably — and at the same time **European-compatible**.

### Three levers
#### 1) Testbeds & sandboxes
New solutions should be trialled in clearly bounded test environments — with measurable goals, transparent evaluation and real learning loops.

#### 2) Public return from public funding
When tax money supports innovation, the benefit must be broadly shared:
- open standards and interoperability as the default
- knowledge transfer instead of silos
- responsible IP models (where sensible)
- "maintenance" built in: not just build, but operate

#### 3) Nationwide innovation network
We connect universities, polytechnics, startups, SMEs and industry across cantons — with clear rules, transparent governance and fast implementation pathways. Where European cooperation is beneficial, we use it.

### Why this fits us
Innovation is not an end in itself. It is a means for:
- better public services
- a more productive economy
- more prosperity and comfort for all
