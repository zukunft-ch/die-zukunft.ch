  { q = "What is an anti-lock-in law?", a = "A law that prevents the state from permanently tying itself to a single IT vendor. It requires exit plans, open formats and data portability as contractual obligations." },
  { q = "Isn't open source more expensive than commercial solutions?", a = "Not necessarily. Open source reduces long-term costs through less licence dependency. What matters is that maintenance is also funded — not just the initial deployment." },
  { q = "How does this affect everyday life?", a = "Fewer IT failures in public services, fewer data breaches, more transparency. And no surprises when a vendor suddenly doubles prices or discontinues their service." },
