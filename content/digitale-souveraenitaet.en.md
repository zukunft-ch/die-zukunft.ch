Digital systems are infrastructure today, like roads and electricity: when they are opaque, insecure or non-cancellable, democracy loses control.

## Our principle

Swiss/EU-first only for critical infrastructure and sensitive data. Otherwise: open competition — but always with auditability, portability and security as requirements.

## The sovereignty package

### 1. Anti-lock-in law

- Exit plans as a contractual requirement
- Open standards and format interfaces
- Data portability and interoperability

### 2. Open-by-default in government

- Open source where sensible (and maintainable)
- Funding for maintenance (not just "build and forget")
- Transparency reports on large government IT systems (risks, dependencies, exit status)

### 3. Security of critical systems

- Minimum standard: controls, audits, incident processes
- Supply-chain security: SBOM, signed builds, traceable provenance
- Clear responsibilities instead of jurisdictional fog

## Why this improves everyday life

- Fewer IT investment failures
- Less dependency on individual vendors
- Lower risk in critical services
- More trust through transparency
