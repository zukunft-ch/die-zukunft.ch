## Not left. Not right. Future-ready.
Today's politics often operates on reflexes: left versus right, crisis versus crisis, camp versus camp. This produces noise — but too rarely solutions.

**The Future** doesn't fit neatly into the left-right spectrum, because the major challenges of our time operate on different axes:
- **Sovereignty vs. dependency**
- **Functionality vs. bureaucracy**
- **Transparency vs. black box**
- **Abundance vs. scarcity thinking**
- **Courage to implement vs. symbolic politics**

We don't want to be "unlabelled" to dodge responsibility — but to **stay capable of action**.

### Our anti-ideology promise
Ideology becomes an obstacle when it prevents things from working. Our benchmark is:
**What makes life better — measurably, robustly, scalably?**

### How we make decisions (our criteria)
1) **Effectiveness**: Is there a real effect in everyday life?
2) **Feasibility**: Is it implementable — legally, financially, operationally?
3) **Sovereignty**: Does it make us more or less dependent in critical areas?
4) **Freedom & dignity**: Does it expand room to act and security?
5) **Transparency**: Is it verifiable, auditable, correctable?

### The typical labels — and why they don't fit
**"Tech-libertarian?"**
No. We are not "state out, market in." We want a **capable state** that creates security, reduces dependencies and enforces transparency — especially for critical infrastructure. Freedom without sovereignty is an illusion.

**"Socialist?"**
No. We are not for planned economies or ideology. Our focus is **abundance through productivity** — and a welfare state that empowers people, instead of trapping them in bureaucracy.

**"Neoliberal?"**
No. We are not for deregulation at any cost. Where markets work: fine. Where lock-in, monopolies or dependencies emerge: **rules, standards, exit obligations, competition**.

**Our self-image:** pragmatic, future-ready, measurable.

### Examples showing why we don't fit the spectrum
- **Digital sovereignty**: not "statist" and not "market-fundamentalist" — but anti-lock-in, pro open standards, pro security.
- **Re-industrialisation via robotics**: pro productivity and prosperity, but SME-friendly, socially secured, without fear of decline.
- **Basic income (pilot)**: a safety foundation that reduces bureaucracy and facilitates entrepreneurship — without moral debates, with measurement instead of dogma.
- **Cities & housing**: pro densification at transit hubs (including height), so housing becomes more affordable and sprawl is reduced.
- **Life science & health**: pro progress, but with clear limits: **no black-box state**, opt-in default, transparency.

### What we reject
- **Fear-based politics** as a permanent state
- **Symbolic politics** without impact
- **Black-box systems** in government and health
- **Culture wars** as a substitute for shaping the future

### What we stand for
A state that makes change possible, rather than merely administering it. A Switzerland that remains sovereign and cooperates constructively with Europe. A society that translates abundance into prosperity, comfort and well-being.

If you've had enough of tribal politics: welcome.
