## Progress with trust

Life sciences are opening new possibilities — from personalised therapies to prevention, from new diagnostics to industrial biotechnology. Switzerland is a world leader in this field. For this to continue, clear rules that build trust are needed.

## Our principles

### Health data: opt-in as standard

Health data belongs to people, not to the state and not to industry. The standard is opt-in, with narrow exceptions only for public health.

### Regulation: evidence-based and traceable

New therapies and technologies are assessed case-by-case — based on evidence, not ideology. Regulatory decisions must be traceable and justified.

### Partnerships: yes — but with transparency rules

Collaboration between government, research and industry is important. But every partnership needs clear transparency rules: who finances? Who decides? Who benefits?

## Red lines

**No black-box state**: No automated decisions about medical services or treatments without traceable reasoning, human responsibility and the right to appeal.

## Why this matters

- Switzerland as a pharma and biotech hub needs a clear framework
- Citizens deserve control over their health data
- Innovation and trust are not contradictory — they are prerequisites for each other
