## Energy & infrastructure resilience
Comfort means: things work. Electricity, networks, mobility, critical supply — reliably, affordably, robustly. This is the foundation for prosperity.

### Our goal
Resilient infrastructure in Switzerland that better absorbs outages and crises and makes costs more predictable — without ideology, without alarmism.

### Our priorities
#### 1) Reliability as the key metric
Infrastructure planning should focus more on uptime, peak-load capability and recoverability.

#### 2) Faster procedures for critical projects
When a project improves supply security, it must not get stuck in endless loops: clear responsibilities, clear deadlines, clear decisions.

#### 3) Reduce critical dependencies
Where disruptions are costly, we secure components, spare parts and know-how — pragmatically and risk-based. Where cooperation with European partners increases resilience, we pursue it.

### Principle
Resilience is **engineering**: standards, redundancy, testing, accountability.
