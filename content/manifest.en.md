## Summary

The Future stands for a good life in the 21st century: prosperity instead of scarcity thinking, security instead of fear, sovereignty instead of dependency.

## We are convinced

- Technological change is real — but fear is optional.
- Productivity can create abundance — if we distribute fairly and secure transitions.
- Sovereignty comes from open standards, transparency and security.
- Democracy wins when systems are understandable, verifiable and correctable.

## Our commitments

### 1. No black-box politics

No automated decisions about benefits or treatment without traceable reasoning, human responsibility and the right to appeal.

### 2. Sovereign state — open systems

The state procures critically only in ways that ensure systems are auditable, portable and secure. Lock-in is a risk — and will be ended.

### 3. Change without collapse

We restructure the welfare state so that people can switch careers, learn and start businesses — without existential fear.

### 4. Basic income, pragmatically

We start with a federal pilot and measure impact: bureaucracy costs, entrepreneurship, well-being.
