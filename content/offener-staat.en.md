## Open government: API-by-default
The state is a service provider for democracy. When data and processes are stuck in silos, gatekeeping emerges: slow, expensive, opaque. That doesn't fit the future.

**Our idea:** The state makes everything that doesn't concern national security **openly, machine-readably and via APIs** available — so citizens, media and businesses can build solutions that simplify processes and strengthen oversight.

### What this means concretely
#### 1) API-by-default
Agencies publish data not just as PDFs, but as reliable interfaces:
- unified standards (formats, identifiers)
- clear versioning and change logs
- stable availability (service level)
- documentation, examples, open-source reference clients

#### 2) "Open procedures" instead of bureaucratic jungle
Every process is described digitally as a workflow:
- requirements and documents
- deadlines and status
- fees
- clear responsibilities
So people can follow procedures — and third parties can build tools that help.

#### 3) Transparency as standard (except security)
Transparency should not depend on goodwill, but be standard:
- budgets and expenditure
- procurement and contracts (where possible)
- government KPIs (processing times etc.)
- job profiles and salary bands (where sensible)

#### 4) Transparency in politics
For democracy to stay clean, clarity is needed:
- party financing and donation flows
- campaign budgets and major funders
- timely and public

#### 5) Citizen oversight in the 21st century
Citizen journalists, NGOs, researchers and interested citizens should be able to effectively scrutinise the state:
- open data
- dashboards
- audit logs and traceable decisions
A modern state is not afraid of oversight — it gets better because of it.

### Our guardrails (so this doesn't become dangerous)
- **National security remains protected.**
- **Privacy-by-design:** minimise personal data, anonymise/aggregate.
- **Security-by-design:** strong standards, audits, clear accountability.
- **No black-box state:** Decisions must be traceable, contestable and accountable.

### Why this increases prosperity and comfort
- less paper and waiting time
- lower administrative costs
- better services through competition and innovation
- more trust through transparency
