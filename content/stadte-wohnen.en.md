## Cities & housing
Prosperity and comfort are felt in everyday life: short commutes, affordable housing, less stress, more quality of life. For this, cities must be able to grow — **upward and inward**, not endlessly outward.

### Our principle
**Densify where infrastructure exists.**
This preserves landscape and village character — and curbs sprawl.

### Three immediate measures
#### 1) More building rights at transit hubs
Around stations and strong tram and bus corridors, more storeys and higher utilisation should be possible. Those who want city life must be allowed to build it — where it works.

#### 2) Fast-track permits for dense housing projects
Good projects often fail not due to engineering, but due to time and process. We want clear deadlines, unified responsibilities and a one-stop process.

#### 3) Minimum densities in defined zones
Near stations and along central corridors, densification should be the norm. This creates supply — and eases pressure on peripheral areas.

### Height: yes, but with rules
- **High-rises** in clearly defined zones (centres/stations) — with strong quality and design requirements.
- **Mid-rise** (e.g. 6–10 storeys) as the standard where it makes urban sense.
The goal is not a skyline — but **housing, comfort and proximity**.

### Affordability without ideology
Affordability comes from a **mix**:
- more supply through targeted densification
- complement through cooperatives and non-profit providers
- stable rental models and planning certainty

### Why this is future policy
- Less commuting stress, less time lost
- More integration: the city as a place of encounter and opportunity
- More nature stays nature — because we don't need to sprawl
