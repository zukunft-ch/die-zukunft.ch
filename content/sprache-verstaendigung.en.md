## Language & understanding
Switzerland is multilingual — and precisely because of this, we know: language is infrastructure. It determines whether people feel welcome, whether work succeeds, whether institutions are comprehensible.

### Our goal
Switzerland should become the model in Europe for:
- clear, simple communication
- strong cultural diversity
- integration without friction

### National languages stay — but we need a shared bridge
We don't want to displace any national language. German, French, Italian (and Romansh) are part of Switzerland.

At the same time, we need an **additional shared lingua franca** to facilitate cooperation nationwide and internationally.

### Why English is the pragmatic choice
English is today's most practical bridge language:
- science and innovation
- international business
- mobility and exchange in Europe and globally

We want important government services and key information to be accessible in English as well — as a genuine aid for integration and location attractiveness.

### Openness to constructed languages
We are open to neutral alternatives like Esperanto — and in the long term also to the idea of a globally more inclusive, constructed lingua franca that doesn't only reflect European language patterns.

What matters to us: this is not a culture war, but a future project for understanding. If it measurably helps create fewer misunderstandings and include more people, it makes sense.

### Implementation: step by step and measurable
- multilingual government information (incl. English) where it has impact
- voluntary learning pathways and recognition of language competences
- programmes for cultural understanding (schools, professional development, integration)
- evaluation: integration success, service quality, economic benefit
